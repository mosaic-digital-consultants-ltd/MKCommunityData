# MK Community Data

A [public tool](https://mkcommunitydata.co.uk) to gather local data and a platform for [Community Action MK] to administer the site and analyse the data.

MK Community Data allows local organisations to report & describe issues, sending them to a central repository in the hope that common threads can be identified and addressed in a more communal & efficient way.
